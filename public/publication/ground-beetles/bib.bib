abstract={The intra-generic relationships within the intriguing genus Petrorhagia are currently debated, as the genus is underrepresented in recent taxonomic studies. In this study, we investigate the relationships among the species of Petrorhagia [sect. Petrorhagia] subsect. Saxifragae occurring in Greece. Based on a combination of ordination methods and discriminant analyses of 36 macromorphological characters, five species are recognized in Greece. The analyses showed that all currently known species from Greece (P. fasciculata, P. graminea, P. phthiotica and P. saxifraga) represent distinct taxonomic entities. According to our results, two recently collected populations from SE Peloponnisos represent a fifth, new Petrorhagia species, which is first described and illustrated here as P. laconica. It is related to the widespread P. saxifraga and the Greek endemic P. graminea, but clearly distinct from both species by a combination of morphological characters, including indumentum, inflorescence, calyx, capsule and seed characters. © 2018 The Authors ·.},

abstract={Silene guicciardii (Caryophyllaceae) was rediscovered after field surveys carried out on Mt. Parnassos (Sterea Ellas, Greece), 160 years after the type collection made by J.B. Samaritani and J. Guicciardi in 1857. Since its first collection, it has been considered either as a distinct species, a variety or a mere synonym of the SW-Asiatic S. marschallii. We provide a revised description of the species and we re-evaluate its taxonomic position and that of the related species. We propose to treat the taxon guicciardii at the subspecific rank of S. marschallii. A color plate of S. marshallii subsp. guicciardii and a distribution map for all subspecies of S. marschallii are also provided. The name Silene guicciardii was lectotypified on a specimen preserved at G-BOIS, while isolectotypes are at G-BOIS, B, BR, C, GOET, JE, K and WU. © 2017 Magnolia Press.},

abstract={In order to assess how the last sea level rise affected the Aegean archipelago, we quantified the magnitude and rate of geographic change for the Aegean islands during the last sea-level-rise episode (21 kyr BP–present) with a spatially explicit geophysical model. An island-specific Area-Distance-Change (ADC) typology was constructed, with higher ADC values representing a higher degree of change. The highest fragmentation rates of the Aegean archipelago occurred in tandem with the largest rates of sea-level-rise occurring between 17 kyr and 7 kyr ago. Sea-level rise resulted in an area loss for the Aegean archipelago of approximately 70%. Spatiotemporal differences in sea-level changes across the Aegean Sea and irregular bathymetry produced a variety of island surface-area loss responses, with area losses ranging from 20% to > 90% per island. In addition, sea-level rise led to increased island isolation, increasing distances of islands to continents to > 200% for some islands. We discuss how rates of area contractions and distance increases may have affected biotas, their evolutionary history and genetics. Five testable hypotheses are proposed to guide future research. We hypothesize that islands with higher ADC-values will exhibit higher degrees of community hyper-saturation, more local extinctions, larger genetic bottlenecks, higher genetic diversity within species pools, more endemics and shared species on continental fragments and higher z-values of the power-law species-area relationship. The developed typology and the quantified geographic response to sea-level rise of continental islands, as in the Aegean Sea, present an ideal research framework to test biogeographic and evolutionary hypotheses assessing the role of rates of area and distance change affecting biota. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Astragalus maniaticus and Aethionema saxatile subsp. corinthiacum have vague taxonomic relationships. Astragalus maniaticus was placed in sect. Hypoglottis but shows affinities to A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii of sect. Platyglottis. The Aethionema saxatile complex is an intriguing group due to the wide distribution and morphological variability of its taxa. In order to elucidate the variation patterns of these two taxa and to test their morphological identity, we carried out several multivariate morphometric (stepwise canonical and classificatory) analyses. They revealed that Astragalus maniaticus cannot be distinguished from A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii on morphological grounds. Therefore, it is transferred to sect. Platyglottis and regarded a heterotypic synonym of A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii. The taxonomic interpretation of Aethionema saxatile subsp. corinthiacum necessitated a broad revision of the Ae. saxatile group in Greece and detection of its relations with Ae. rhodopaeum, a Bulgarian endemic. The analyses showed that Ae. saxatile subsp. corinthiacum represents a distinct taxon; likewise, three additional subspecies receive support of similar strength: subsp. creticum, subsp. graecum and subsp. oreophilum. Intermediate forms between subsp. oreophilum and subsp. saxatile were detected in NW Greece. Ae. rhodopaeum is more variable than its original circumscription and is considered as another subspecies of Ae. saxatile. © 2016 Società Botanica Italiana.},

abstract={Aim: The Aegean Archipelago has been the focal research area for identifying and testing several ecological and evolutionary patterns, yet its biogeographical subdivision has been somewhat overlooked, with the processes driving the assembly of the Aegean island plant communities still remaining largely unclear. To bridge this gap, we identify the biogeographical modules (highly linked subgroups of islands and plant taxa) within the Aegean Archipelago. Location: The Aegean Archipelago, Greece. Methods: We used a network approach to detect island biogeographical roles and modules, based on a large and detailed database including 1498 Aegean endemic and subendemic plant taxa distributed on 59 Aegean Islands and five adjacent mainland areas. Results: The Aegean was divided into six biogeographical modules; the network was significantly modular. None of the modules displayed all four possible biogeographical roles (connectors, module hubs, network hubs, peripherals). Six new biogeographical regions in the Aegean were identified. Main conclusions: The borders of the six biogeographical regions in the Aegean correspond well to the region's palaeogeographical evolution from the middle Miocene to the end of the Pleistocene. The Central Aegean acts as an ecogeographical filter for the distribution of several plant lineages across the Aegean Sea, while there seems to be a N–S-oriented biogeographical barrier in the Aegean corresponding to the palaeogeographical situation during the middle Ionian. These biogeographical barriers have been fundamental for both plants and animals. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Background: The South Aegean Volcanic Arc (SAVA), one of the most notable geological structures of the Mediterranean Sea, is floristically well known. Nevertheless, the factors that contribute to shaping the plant species richness of the SAVA remain unclear. Aims: To investigate the factors that affect plant species richness and identify plant diversity hotspots in the SAVA and other central Aegean islands. Methods: We used stepwise multiple regression to test the relationship between a number of environmental factors and plant species richness in the SAVA, as well as the residuals from the species–area linear regressions of native, Greek and Cycladian endemic taxa as indicators of relative species richness. Results: The area was confirmed to be the most powerful single explanatory variable of island species richness, while geodiversity, maximum elevation and mean annual precipitation explained a large proportion of variance for almost all the species richness measures. Anafi, Amorgos and Folegandros were found to be endemic plant diversity hotspots. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that geodiversity is an important factor in shaping plant species diversity in the Cyclades, while mean annual precipitation, human population density and maximum elevation were significant predictors of the Greek endemics present in the Cyclades. Finally, Anafi was found to be a plant diversity hotspot in the South Aegean Sea. © 2014, © 2014 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Stachys virgata, a rare Greek member of S. subsect. Rectae, was hitherto known from historical collections made in the north-eastern and southern parts of Peloponnisos, the last one dated in 1844. Its only recent record, on Poros Island in 1940, is not supported by a herbarium specimen. The species was rediscovered in 2005, 161 years after its last collection, and subsequently documented in 18 populations (1 of them now extinct) distributed along the eastern slopes of Mt. Parnonas and Mt. Madara in east Peloponnisos. We review the species’ description and distribution based on both historical records and recent collections, select a specimen deposited in the Natural History Museum, Paris (P) as a lectotype, and count its chromosome number, 2n = 34, for the first time. We evaluate the species’ taxonomic relationships and consider its threats and conservation status based on our own field work and several years of monitoring. S. virgata totals 355 mature plants and 12 out of its 18 populations comprise 20 plants or fewer. Based on the IUCN criteria, S. virgata falls under the Endangered (EN) category and specific conservation measures are proposed. Finally, we provide a key distinguishing S. virgata from the other Greek members of S. subsect. Rectae. © 2015 Magnolia Press},

Methods: We used a network approach to detect island biogeographical roles and modules, based on a large and detailed database of the Greek endemic plant taxa of the Cyclades, and we tested for nestedness in the island-species matrices.

abstract={Background: This study presents the native flora of Mountain Panachaikon (N.W. Peloponnese, Greece), after extensive field work (from ~700 to 1900 m) and critical literature review.Results: The vascular native flora of Mt. Panachaikon comprises 757 taxa, 95 of which are Greek endemics, 79 are Balkan endemics, while 229 taxa are reported here for the first time. The known distribution of the Greek endemics Alyssum montanum subsp. montanum var. graecum, Carum heldreichii, Cirsium heldreichii, Genista milii, Minuartia eurytanica and Seseli parnassicum is expanded, being reported for the first time for the floristic region of Peloponnese, and the number of the known populations of the Near Threatened Gymnospermium altaicum subsp. peloponnesiacum is increased.Conclusions: The study area appears to have the second highest endemism and the highest one in W. Greece, compared with other mountains of N. Peloponnese and Sterea Ellada, while 22.10% of the endemics are protected and/or evaluated as Near Threatened to Endangered. It also exhibits a rather high proportion of Balkan endemics, in relation to its geographic location, and some genuine arctic-alpine taxa. These indicate that Mt. Panachaikon can be rendered as a plant diversity hotspot in the Peloponnese. © 2014 Kokkoris et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Phrygana, maquis and subalpine shrublands are the most typical ecosystem types on the island of Crete. However, these formations are mostly mismanaged and poorly studied in terms of their fauna and the effect of long term land-use. We studied the impact of goat and sheep grazing on the diversity patterns of carabid beetles at 40 sites in relation to possible habitat uniqueness and geographic zonation. In total, 19,322 individuals belonging to 42 Carabidae species were identified. The composition of site assemblages was mainly determined by altitude. The six Cretan endemic species collected were widely distributed on the island and most of them were dominant. Species richness and equitability were significantly lower at overgrazed sites compared to areas with low grazing intensity. The diversity patterns of carabids were influenced by the level of grazing in each study area. As species richness and diversity were maximal under moderate/relatively high levels of grazing (hump-shaped pattern), our results support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Low tolerance of carabid taxa to intensive grazing was also ascertained through the significantly high values of temporal beta diversity at overgrazed sites, independent of local species richness. We conclude that Carabidae are good indicators of grazing pressure in Crete at assemblage level, rather than species-specifically. To maintain diversity and enhance niche space of invertebrate fauna, the spatiotemporal discontinuity of grazing is essential. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The study area has the highest percentage of endemism in the Saronic Gulf. Additionally, for some endemic taxa, their known distribution is expanded. These include Crocus sieberi subsp. atticus and Ophrys oestrifera subsp. leptomera, reported for the first time for the phytogeographical region of the Peloponnese; Campanula andrewsii subsp. hirsutula and Colchicum psaridis, reported for the first time for the North Peloponnese; and Trigonella rechingeri, reported for the first time from the Greek mainland. The floristic affinities between the study area and the large islands of the Saronic Gulf are examined by the application of Sørensen's index to investigate the relationships between them. © 2012 Trustees of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.},

abstract={The island of Anafi, located in the southern Kiklades in Greece, constitutes together with the Santorini island group the central part of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. The flora of Anafi consists of 635 taxa, 128 of which are under a protection status, 37 are Greek endemics and 181 are reported here for the first time. We show that Anafi has the highest percentage of Greek endemics in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. The known distribution of the endemics Sedum littoreum var. creticum and Sternbergia greuteriana is expanded, being reported for the first time for the phytogeographical region of the Kiklades, and the indigenous presence of Phoenix theophrasti in Anafi is confirmed. Calculating the floristic cross-correlation between Anafi and the other parts of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc by means of Sørensen's index revealed that phytogeographical affinities are somewhat stronger to Milos than to the neighbouring Santorini. © 2012 BGBM Berlin-Dahlem.},
