      <description>body {text-align: justify}OverviewThe second year of SoBEx has been hard, since due to covid-19 restrictions our team was not able to work properly or conduct field research for all the species we study.
What has been doneSo far we have conducted molecular/genetic analyses for most of the studied animal and plant taxa. We have also run several macroecological analyses so as to estimate the effects of climate change on these Critically Endangered species, as well as to estimate the percent overlap of these speciesâ€™ distribution range with the NATURA 2000 protected areas network (PAs - gap analysis).</description>

      <description>Job opening In our project entitled Species on the brink of extinction funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT) under grant agreement No 2418, we are offering three (3) short-term post-graduate positions.
Requirements If you are enthusiastic about working in the field, collecting plant and animal samples and have (some) experience in spatial analysis, species distribution modelling and molecular/genetic techniques, then you should probably consider to apply for one of these positions.</description>
