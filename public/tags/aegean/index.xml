      <description>Job opening In our project entitled Species on the brink of extinction funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT) under grant agreement No 2418, we are offering three (3) short-term post-graduate positions.
Requirements If you are enthusiastic about working in the field, collecting plant and animal samples and have (some) experience in spatial analysis, species distribution modelling and molecular/genetic techniques, then you should probably consider to apply for one of these positions.</description>

      <description>Why focus on continental archipelagos? Although oceanic islands are less numerous compared to the non-oceanic, they dominate ecological and evolutionary theory, compared to continental island systems, which have received much less attention than oceanic islands and archipelagos (e.g., Whittaker et al., 2017). Thus, continental archipelagos, such as the Aegean, provide exceptional opportunities for the refinement and further development of island theory, especially those parts mainly based on oceanic islands.</description>

      <description>The pioneers The modern botanical exploration of the Aegean Islands dates back to the late 18th century. The substantial plant distribution data collected by pioneer botanists working in the Aegean enabled Turrill in 1929 to first divide the area in six phytogeographical regions. Nearly two decades later, Karl-Heinz Rechinger from the Natural History Museum of Vienna based on his extensive plant collections first addressed the phytogeographical peculiarities of the Aegean (e.</description>
