      <description>Biodiversity in the Anthropocene We have now entered a novel geological epoch, the Anthropocene, which is characterized by severe anthropogenic pressures to the global environment. The planet is facing an unprecedented biodiversity crisis, with current extinction rates 1000 times higher than the background extinction rate. In order to halt this phenomenon, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) established the currently running CBD ‘Aichi’ Targets, the most important of which is Target 12: ‘by 2020, the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained’.</description>
