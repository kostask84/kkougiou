      <description>body {text-align: justify}OverviewThe second year of SoBEx has been hard, since due to covid-19 restrictions our team was not able to work properly or conduct field research for all the species we study.
What has been doneSo far we have conducted molecular/genetic analyses for most of the studied animal and plant taxa. We have also run several macroecological analyses so as to estimate the effects of climate change on these Critically Endangered species, as well as to estimate the percent overlap of these speciesâ€™ distribution range with the NATURA 2000 protected areas network (PAs - gap analysis).</description>
