Consequently, we are unaware of the extent that Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) of the Natura 2000 network efficiently protect Greek plant diversity. Here, we located for the first time at a national scale and in a phylogenetic framework, the areas serv-ing as BH and EC, and assessed the effectiveness of the Greek SAC in safeguarding them. BH and EC are mainly located near mountainous areas, and in areas supposedly floristically impover-ished, such as the central Aegean islands. A critical re-assessment of the Greek SAC might be needed to minimize the extinction risk of the Greek endemics, by focusing the conservation ef-forts also on the BH and EC that fall outside the established Greek SAC.","tags":["biodiversity conservation","CANAPE","conservation prioritization","ecosystem services","EU biodiversity strategy","GIS analysis","Mediterranean flora","phylogenetic diversity","taxonomic diversity"],"title":"Plant Endemism Centres and Biodiversity Hotspots in Greece ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

The climate change impacts will severely alter the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns at all scales, leading to biotic homogenization. Due to underfunding, a climate smart, conservation-prioritization scheme is needed to optimize species protection. Spatial phylogenetics enable the identification of endemism centers and provide valuable insights regarding the eco-evolutionary and conservation value, as well as the biogeographical origin of a given area. Many studies exist regarding the conservation prioritization of mainland areas, yet none has assessed how climate change might alter the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns of an island biodiversity hotspot. Thus, we conducted a phylogenetically informed, conservation prioritization study dealing with the effects of climate change on Crete’s plant diversity and biogeographical patterns. Using several macroecological analyses, we identified the current and future endemism centers and assessed the impact of climate change on the biogeographical patterns in Crete. The highlands of Cretan mountains have served as both diversity cradles and museums, due to their stable climate and high topographical heterogeneity, providing important ecosystem services. Historical processes seem to have driven diversification and endemic species distribution in Crete. Due to the changing climate and the subsequent biotic homogenization, Crete’s unique bioregionalization, which strongly reminiscent the spatial configuration of the Pliocene/Pleistocene Cretan paleo-islands, will drastically change. The emergence of the ‘Anthropocene’ era calls for the prioritization of biodiversity-rich areas, serving as mixed-endemism centers, with high overlaps among protected areas and climatic refugia.","tags":["CANAPE","conservation prioritization","ecosystem services","endemism","Mediterranean flora","phylogenetic diversity","phylogenetic endemism","plant diversity","vascular plants"],"title":"Spatial Phylogenetics, Biogeographical Patterns and Conservation Implications of the Endemic Flora of Crete (Aegean, Greece) under Climate Change Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

Several studies exist regarding climate change’s impacts on European plants, yet none has investigated how climate change will affect the extinction risk of the entire endemic flora of an island biodiversity hotspot, with intense human disturbance. Our aim is to assess climate change’s impacts on the biodiversity patterns of the endemic plants of Crete (S Aegean) and provide a case-study upon which a climate-smart conservation planning strategy might be set. We employed a variety of macroecological analyses and estimated the current and future biodiversity, conservation and extinction hotspots in Crete. We evaluated the effectiveness of climatic refugia and the Natura 2000 network of protected areas (PAs) for protecting the most vulnerable species and identified the taxa of conservation priority based on the Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) index. The results revealed that high altitude areas of Cretan mountains constitute biodiversity hotspots and areas of high conservation and evolutionary value. Due to the “escalator to extinction” phenomenon, these areas are projected to become diversity “death-zones” and should thus be prioritised. Conservation efforts should be targeted at areas with overlaps among PAs and climatic refugia, characterised by high diversity and EDGE scores. This conservation-prioritisation planning will allow the preservation of evolutionary heritage, trait diversity and future ecosystem services for human well-being and acts as a pilot for similar regions worldwide.","tags":["Continental island","Endemics","Environmental management","Extinction risk","Mediterranean flora","Natura 2000","Species distribution modelling","IUCN"],"title":"Plant Diversity Patterns and Conservation Implications under Climate-Change Scenarios in the Mediterranean: The Case of Crete (Aegean, Greece)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Th.

The pattern has recently gained widespread support. However, few studies have attempted to identify the actual mechanisms driving the SIE. Here, we use a phylogenetic community framework to study the SIE, based on the assumption that if the dominant assembly processes differ between small and large islands, patterns of phylogenetic community structure should shift across the area and habitat diversity gradient.  __Location:__ The Aegean Archipelago, Greece. __Methods:__ We used a large dataset of 3262 vascular plant species distributed across 173 islands, in combination with a species-level phylogeny. The phylogenetic community structure of each island was calculated using a null modelling framework and was quantified using effect sizes (ES); negative values indicating phylogenetic clustering and positive values overdispersion. Habitat diversity, species richness, phylogenetic diversity (PD) and ES values were regressed against log10 -transformed area and we tested for a SIE using piecewise regression models. We also assessed differences in taxonomic and phylogenetic composition between small and large islands using a beta-diversity framework. __Results:__ We found evidence of a SIE using species richness, PD, and phylogenetic community structure (ES values). Small islands displayed low variation in habitat diversity and tended to be more phylogenetically clustered, while large islands shifted from phylogenetic clustering towards phylogenetic overdispersion with increasing area and habitat diversity. In addition, we showed that phylogenetic composition tended to be more similar between small islands than expected. __Main conclusion:__ Overall, our results provide an example of a SIE in the analysis of island phylogenetic community structure, and point to a role of habitat diversity in driving the SIE more generally.","tags":["Breakpoints","island biogeography","phylogenetic diversity","small-island effect","species-area relationship","beta-diversity"],"title":"Unravelling the small-island effect through phylogenetic community ecology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Moreover, genetic diversity patterns of mountain forest herbaceous species have scarcely been explored in the Balkans. In this context, our study is the first that aims to examine Helleborus odorus subsp. cyclophyllus, a medicinal plant endemic to the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula. __Background and Objectives:__ We compare its genetic diversity and structure along the continuous mountain range of western Greece with the topographically less structured mountains of eastern Greece, and predict its present and future habitat suitability, using several environmental variables. __Materials and Methods:__ Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers were used to genotype 80 individuals from 8 populations, covering almost the species’ entire distribution range in Greece. We investigated the factors shaping its genetic composition and driving its current and future distribution. __Results:__ High gene diversity (0.2239–0.3319), moderate population differentiation (0.0317–0.3316) and increased gene flow (Nm = 1.3098) was detected. According to any GCM/RCP/climate database combination, Helleborus odorus subsp. cyclophyllus is projected to lose a significant portion of its current distribution by 2070 and follow a trend towards genetic homogenization. __Conclusions:__ Populations exhibit in terms of genetic structure a west–east genetic split, which becomes more evident southwards. This is mainly due to geographic/topographic factors and their interplay with Quaternary climatic oscillations, and to environmental constraints, which may have a negative impact on the species’ future distribution and genetic composition. Pindos mountain range seems to buffer climate change effects and will probably continue to host several populations. On the other hand, peripheral populations have lower genetic diversity compared to central populations, but still hold significant evolutionary potential due to the private alleles they maintain.","tags":["Climate alterations","mid-elevation plants","Range distribution","Genetic variability","Molecular markers"],"title":"Genetic Diversity and Range Dynamics of Helleborus Odorus Subsp.

In this study, the genetic diversity of five populations of Cicer graecum, an endangered endemic species from Northern Peloponnisos, Greece and a wild relative of the cultivated Cicer arietinum, was investigated using Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers in order to determine levels and structure of genetic variability. Nei’s gene diversity by ISSR and AFLP markers indicated medium to high genetic diversity at the population level. Moreover, AMOVA results suggest that most of the variation exists within (93% for AFLPs and 65% for ISSRs), rather than among populations. Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis based on ISSRs positively correlated the genetic differentiation among the populations to the geographic distances, suggesting that the gene flow among distant populations is limited. The ecological adaptation of C. graecum populations was also investigated by correlation of their genetic diversity with certain environmental variables. Aridity arose as the dominant factor positively affecting the genetic diversity of C. graecum populations. We modeled the realized climatic niche of C. graecum in an ensemble forecasting scheme under three different global circulation models and two climate change scenarios. In all cases, a severe range contraction for C. graecum is projected, highlighting the high extinction risk that is probably going to face during the coming decades. These results could be a valuable tool towards the implementation of an integrated in situ and ex situ conservation scheme approach for activating management programs for this endemic and threatened species.","tags":["Conservation","Biodiversity","Climate change","Extinction risk","Genetic diversity"],"title":"Population genetic variability and distribution of the endangered Greek endemic Cicer graecum under climate change scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

The study area lies in the biogeographical region of the West Aegean islands and comprises 23 islands and islets. The total flora of the study area consists of 1202 infrageneric taxa, belonging to 517 genera and 120 families, reflecting its geographical and bioclimatic characteristics. The endemic element consists of 41 taxa (3.4% of the flora), eight of which are restricted to the West Aegean islands and two are single island endemics. Area emerged as the most important variable in shaping plant species richness, while niche-based processes played a lesser role in driving these patterns. Regarding the taxonomic and phylogenetic beta-diversity patterns, environmental filtering and not dispersal limitation seems to shape the plant assemblages of the Northern Sporades islets. Biogeographically, the Northern Sporades island group seems to be closer connected to the Kiklades rather than to Evvia or the adjacent mainland, due to their longer isolation and separate palaeogeographical history during the Quaternary.","tags":["Biogeography","Biodiversity","Endemism","Aegean"],"title":"Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity patterns in the Northern Sporades islets complex (West Aegean, Greece)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Kostas Kougioumoutzis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582192800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582192800,"objectID":"9b9319caff41d2ca36381f54f758244a","permalink":"https://www.kkougiou.com/talk/first-talk/","publishdate":"2020-02-20T12:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/first-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Σε αυτή την πρώτη διάλεξη οι συμμετέχοντες θα γνωρίσουν το περιεχόμενο του μαθήματος, καθώς και ότι απαιτείται προκειμένου να εξεταστούν επιτυχώς σε αυτό, ενώ θα επιλυθούν όλες τους οι απορίες.","tags":[],"title":"Πρώτη διάλεξη - Ειδικά Μαθήματα Βοτανικής","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["General"],"content":"\r\rbody {\rtext-align: justify}\r\rOverview\rDuring the past year, the SoBEx team, together with Yannis Alexiou, Gabriela Kelaidi and Chrysa Papadaki, three post-graduate students in UAMECO lab has been conducting field work in several Aegean islands (Figure 1), mainland Greek mountains (Figure 2) and lakes, so as to collect population and environmental data for the Critically Endangered Greek endemic animal and plant species (according to the IUCN).\n\rFigure 1: SoBEx team on Kythira, near the Polygala helenae site\r\r\rFigure 2: At Mt.

Over-collection of orchids for salep is believed to be a growing threat to wild species, yet very little research has concentrated on orchid populations in the wild. Here, we studied the impact of salep collection on population demographic parameters and uniformity of distribution patterns of the Elder-flowered orchid, Dactylorhiza sambucina, the most commonly collected orchid in northern Greece. __Methods__: We carried out fieldwork in four meadows where salep harvesting occurs, and conducted interviews in villages close to these sites. Fieldwork focused on the demographic parameters of orchid populations and on the characteristics of their habitat (natural-anthropogenic). We also measured population size and distribution, extent and multi-scale density, comparing distributions to Poisson and fractal models. __Results__: According to interviews, salep collection by the local community has decreased, contrary to collection by people outside the community, which is increasing. Interviewees did not believe that orchid abundance was higher in the past; they claim that it can be very variable. None of the participants seemed aware of the legislation to conserve orchids. Demographic parameters did not seem to be strongly dependent on whether it was a harvested and non-harvested sites and population density was greatest in the site of highest collection pressure. __Conclusions__: Our findings show that salep collection is still ongoing in Epirus. Our interview results and our population study indicate that current levels of collection are not significantly affecting the abundance of the Elder-flowered orchid in Epirus subalpine meadows. However, the expanding commercial collection could reach levels that threaten the species. There is a need for a longer-term monitoring of these orchid populations, and a more effective modeling of the species’ response to different harvesting pressures.","tags":["Orchids","Salep","Grazing","Conservation value","Northern Greece","Northern Pindos National Park"],"title":"Implications of salep collection for the conservation of the Elder‑flowered orchid Dactylorhiza sambucina) in Epirus, Greece","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["General"],"content":" Job opening In our project entitled Species on the brink of extinction funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT) under grant agreement No 2418, we are offering three (3) short-term post-graduate positions.\nRequirements If you are enthusiastic about working in the field, collecting plant and animal samples and have (some) experience in spatial analysis, species distribution modelling and molecular/genetic techniques, then you should probably consider to apply for one of these positions.

Every day, even in his late 70s, he would have a brief siesta and wake up after an hour or two and head to his fields and crops. Me joining him was inevitable and thrilling: in one of those hikes, I was introduced to the world of plants and how they (all!) can be benificial to us. As we were walking in the olive groves, my grandpa showed me one of the plants he and his seven sisters were eating during the German Occupation. It didn’t seem like much, but it kept them alive. And boy, oh boy what a plant that is: it’s everywhere2 in Crete, it’s edible, it’s called Petromarulo (from Petra - meaning rock - and Marouli - meaning lettuce) and it’s one of the seven endemic genera of Greece (Figure 3)!\n\rFigure 3: Petromarula pinnata (L.) A.DC., a monotypic, endemic plant genus of Greece (Photo by Amadej Trnkoczy in Flickr)\r\rA couple of years later, I got accepted in the Biology Department of the University of Patras. Little did I know then, but it would become my home for the years to come. Several great people taught there and I was lucky enough to be at a place that Botany was thriving. In my first year as a student there, I met a person that would shape me to the academic I am now and to whom I owe everything: Ass. Prof. Argyro Tiniakou. Surely Prof. Grigoris Iatrou with his larger-than-life persona and great teaching skills sparkled my interest to study plant systematics, after attending his course in my second year and definitely Roula Trigou, a M.Sc. student at the time, helped realize how fun it can be trying to identify the plant specimens that lay in front of you3, but it was Ass. Prof. Argyro Tiniakou, that taught me how to think, write, speak scientifically, ask the right questions, push myself to the limit, broaden my horizons and properly collect, identify and store plant specimens.\n\rMumble in the jungle or what I like talking about\rIf you’ve made it this far, kudos to you! You are extremely patient and a great listener - rare commodities these days. I love doing many things, most of which are pretty lonely: reading4, hiking, going to the gym5, binge-watching series6, some more reading7, but what I really like doing is teaching and sharing what I know/learned over the years. So, I will try to write (semi-)regularly some posts dealing with R, starting from scratch and then possibly progressing to more advanced topics and analyses. Now, that I think about it, I may as well write about plant evolution and systematics, since only once did I have the chance to talk and teach (on an academic level) about my favourite organisms on the planet8.\nSo there you have it guys!\nReferences\rDimopoulos, Panayotis, Thomas Raus, Erwin Bergmeier, Theophanis Constantinidis, Gregoris Iatrou, Stella Kokkini, Arne Strid, and Dimitrios Tzanoudakis. 2013. “Vascular Plants of Greece: An Annotated Checklist.” Englera, no. 31.

Although oceanic islands are less numerous compared to the non-oceanic, they dominate ecological and evolutionary theory, compared to continental island systems, which have received much less attention than oceanic islands and archipelagos (e.g., Whittaker et al., 2017). Thus, continental archipelagos, such as the Aegean, provide exceptional opportunities for the refinement and further development of island theory, especially those parts mainly based on oceanic islands.\nThe Aegean archipelago The present-day Aegean archipelago has been shaped by the differential influences of tectonic activity, volcanism and eustatism. Except of the islands of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, the Aegean Islands are of continental origin Francalanci et al., 2005 and differ significantly in their isolation history (e.g., Kapsimalis et al., 2009; Sakellariou \u0026amp; Galanidou, 2016). The Aegean Sea is located on the margin of the African and the Aegean-Anatolian tectonic plates, whose intermittent connection over geological time [e.g., the Mediterranean desiccation during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) and the Pleistocene glaciations] has enabled biotic exchange between the several Aegean biogeographical regions (e.g., Poulakakis et al., 2015; Kougioumoutzis et al., 2017; Sfenthourakis \u0026amp; Triantis, 2017). This complex palaeogeographical history of the Aegean has had a profound impact on the distribution (Kougioumoutzis et al. 2017) and diversification of several plant lineages in the region (e.g., Crowl et al., 2015; Jaros et al., 2018 ) and has contributed significantly to the emergence of this global biodiversity hotspot.\nPrevious studies Intensive field work has taken place in the Aegean phytogeographical regions of Greece (see Dimopoulos et al., 2016) and this has culminated in a wealth of research papers dealing with the species richness patterns of the Aegean archipelago (e.g., Panitsa et al., 2006, 2008, 2010; Trigas et al., 2008, 2013; Kallimanis et al., 2010, 2011), providing valuable insights regarding the factors driving the native and endemic species richness patterns in the Aegean archipelago.\nAegean biodiversity in numbers The Aegean biogeographical regions host ca. 3300 plant taxa, 685 of which are Greek endemics and 478 Aegean endemics1. But bear in mind that since then, several new taxa have been described from the Aegean region.] (i.e., occurring exclusively on the Aegean islands). The richest and the poorest - in species richness terms - region is that of the East Aegean Islands and the Cyclades, respectively. Since endemism rates in Greece diminish in a N-S axis, the Aegean could not be an exception to this rule: the highest endemism rate (17.7%) is observed in the biogeographical region of Kriti-Karpathos, while the lowest (ca. 3%) in the biogeographical region of the North Aegean Islands2.\nThe Cyclades The biogeographical region of the Cyclades (Kik) has been traditionally considered as floristically impoverished (see Phitos et al., 1995), due to its lower species richness, compared to the other Aegean biogeographical regions. That view is now overturned: Kik emerges as the second richest Aegean phytogeographical region in terms of Greek and Aegean endemic plant species richness and no longer stands out as the poorest Aegean phytogeographical region (see Kougioumoutzis \u0026amp; Tiniakou, 2014 and Figure 4 in Panitsa et al., 2018).\nBiodiversity hotspots Kriti constitutes the most important endemic hotspot not only in the Aegean, but in the Mediterranean Basin as well (e.g., Medail, 2017). Anafi - a rather smal, remote, highly geodiverse island - stands out the most important plant diversity hotspot, not only in the Cycladic archipelago, but also in the whole South Aegean Sea. Finally, the South Aegean Volcanic Arc (i.e., SAVA) seems to be not only one of the most significant geological structures in the Mediterranean area, but also of great conservation value, as the areas comprising it host in their vast majority well above average native and endemic taxa.\n Sensu Strid \u0026amp; Tan, 2017 and other sources ^ Data from Dimopoulos et al., 2013, 2016 ^   ","date":1546984800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546984800,"objectID":"eadb2fd6ace6bb42290affd522009eff","permalink":"https://www.kkougiou.com/project/aegean-diversity/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/aegean-diversity/","section":"project","summary":"The Aegean archipelago hosts more than 8,000 islands and 3000 plant taxa.","tags":["Aegean","Biodiversity","Greece","SAVA","Greuter","Runemark","Snogerup","Strid","UPA"],"title":"Aegean biodiversity","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The pioneers The modern botanical exploration of the Aegean Islands dates back to the late 18th century. The substantial plant distribution data collected by pioneer botanists working in the Aegean enabled Turrill in 1929 to first divide the area in six phytogeographical regions. Nearly two decades later, Karl-Heinz Rechinger from the Natural History Museum of Vienna based on his extensive plant collections first addressed the phytogeographical peculiarities of the Aegean (e.g., Kykladenfenster, i.e., the absence of several taxa from the Central Aegean that are present in the Greek mainland and in the East Aegean Islands).\nBoth Turill and Rechinger noticed the abrupt phytogeographical differences between the Kiklades and the East Aegean Islands, drew the phytogeographical line dividing Asia from Europe (i.e. Rechinger’s line) and laid the foundations of the Aegean’s prevailing phytogeographical subdivision. Half a century later, Strid \u0026amp; Tan divided the Aegean into five biogeographical regions; this subdivision was essentially a practical one and it is widely accepted and used in most of the floristic and phytogeographical studies.\nRecent advances Building upon the aforementioned phytogeographical subdivision, Kougioumoutzis et al. (2017) presented the most recent biogeographical classification of the Aegean archipelago. Via a network optimization approach, six large highly linked subgroups of islands and plant taxa (biogeographical modules) were identified in the Aegean (see the figure below).\nThe northernmost module (NMI) consists of Thasos and Samothraki together with north mainland Greece (NE). In module SMI, Evvia and the western part of South Aegean island arc are grouped together with the southern parts of mainland Greece (Peloponnese: Pe, and Sterea Hellas: StE). Ιn the Central Aegean module (CAE), the Kiklades are grouped together with Northern Sporades and Limnos. North-Eastern Aegean module (NE-AE) extends from Lesvos to Kos. The Southeast Aegean module (SE-AE) is formed by the complexes of Rhodos, Karpathos, Nisyros, Tilos, Symi and Chalki and Crete is a separated phytogeographical region (KR).\nDivision-makers The delimitation of these six Aegean biogeographical regions is in almost complete harmony with the archipelago’s palaeogeographical evolution from the middle Miocene to the end of the Pleistocene (see the figure below).\nThe biogeographical barriers of the mid-Aegean trench and the North Aegean trough seem to have influenced plant distribution patterns and the phytogeographical subdivision of the Aegean, both locally and regionally, is similar to the Aegean’s past and contemporary climatic differentiation.\n","date":1546984800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546984800,"objectID":"953d9f398c9cf15a30546b297dcd1529","permalink":"https://www.kkougiou.com/project/aegean-biogeography/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/aegean-biogeography/","section":"project","summary":"The Aegean archipelago is one of the largest archipelagos in the world and has long fascinated biogeographers due to its high environmental heterogeneity, complex palaeogeography, high diversity and endemism.","tags":["Aegean","Biogeography","Greece","Greuter","Rechinger","Runemark","Snogerup","Strid","UPA"],"title":"Aegean biogeography","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Greece\u0026rsquo;s remarkable plant diversity Greece hosts more than 6600 plant taxa, accounting for ca. 30% of the European flora, even though it consists a small fragment of Europe\u0026rsquo;s area.

The planet is facing an unprecedented biodiversity crisis, with current extinction rates 1000 times higher than the background extinction rate. In order to halt this phenomenon, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) established the currently running CBD ‘Aichi’ Targets, the most important of which is Target 12: ‘by 2020, the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained’. Nevertheless, despite the development of numerous conservation initiatives, predictions on biodiversity loss detainment remain rather ominous: extinction rates under current management schemes continue to increase and are bound to accelerate under any potential future climate scenario1. Current practices fail to keep track of the efficiency/success of implemented measures, since current conservation spending remains well below that required to restore rates of extinction to natural levels. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is at the forefront of global conservation endeavors and classifies taxa into 9 threat categories according to population and geographical criteria. Thus far, IUCN has assessed 85,604 species globally, with nearly 30% (24307 taxa) rendered as threatened due to rapid habitat loss and ecological disruption. However, not only the status assessment was based – in most cases – solely on geographic coverage criteria, thus failing to harbor crucial elements of species fitness, (e.g., population size and genetic diversity), but also 17% of the species’ IUCN assessments are already outdated, as a result of underfunding.\nA triage enigma The persistent and often escalating threats to biodiversity, coupled with underfunding, make it inevitable that conservation managers apply a triage procedure in decision making. Conservation triage focuses on prioritizing species, populations or habitats based on biodiversity benefits, recovery potential and costs to achieve a desired goal. An effective tool towards that end is Population Viability Analysis (PVA) coupled with Species Distribution Models (SDMs). PVA is used to support conservation decision making by providing empirical evaluations of different management actions for the species or population in question. SDMs are the most widely used tools to forecast the effects of climate change on biodiversity and greatly enhance the effectiveness of conservation actions.\nBiodiversity in numbers Greece lies at the center of the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, one of the most important biodiversity hotspots worldwide. Greece hosts ca. 32% (2529 species) of the European IUCN flora and fauna2. Currently, 74 Critically Endangered, 119 Endangered and 180 Vulnerable species (IUCN 2017) at national and global level occur in Greece. Greece is no exception as to the doubtful efficiency of global conservation efforts. Fifty of the CR taxa were assessed prior to 2012 and were classified as such, based solely on geographical criteria and without any data regarding their population trend; the latter being one of the most fundamental criteria regarding the threat categorization according to IUCN.\nOur goal and mission Most conservation studies focus only on the extent and quality of the species habitat. It is only for the few charismatic species that conservation efforts include aspects of species biology, such as genetic diversity, reproductive success, and monitoring of population size. Therefore, there is an urgent need to include genetic data and species distribution modelling in the extinction risk estimation of threatened and endangered taxa, so as to improve the assessment of such taxa, since not a single taxon has been evaluated under this integrated and multidisciplinary scheme. Thus, the current project will try to address this gap, by compiling and assessing scientific information on the geographical distribution, population dynamics, and genetic diversity in order to provide a solid informative background for designing more effective conservation measures. This will be carried out for all the Critically Endangered species reported from Greece and the current project will actually constitute the first synthetic assessment of the most prone to extinction species in the EU and the globe.\nIn the next years, we will try to:\n estimate the levels of intra- and inter-population genetic diversity and consequently, we will lay the basis for future management and fundamentally contribute to a comprehensive evaluation of species extinction risk. In parallel, we will employ a phylogenetic analysis framework to elucidate the differentiation among populations and reveal the potential existence of meta-population structures across different populations of the same species. This is of uttermost importance, as it will shed light on the species’ vulnerability as a whole, caused by genetic bottlenecks and genetic drift driven stochasticity.\n perform PVA modelling of the effects of demographic, environmental and genetic stochasticity and its results will be used to support conservation decision making by providing empirical evaluations of different currently operating management actions for the species and populations in question.\n apply SDM techniques in order to provide an estimate regarding the projected species ranges under future climate change scenarios and identify the species more likely to face severe environmental pressure.\n to identify potential gaps between current CR species occurrences and protection areas and reveal geographic mismatches and thus potential shortcomings in protection measures.\n  This project has received funding from the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT), under grant agreement No [2418].\n See Urban, M.

We studied the impact of sheep and goat grazing on 50 assemblages of ground spiders (Araneae: Gnaphosidae) in phryganic, maquis and forest habitats from zero to 2000m elevation on Crete, Greece using pitfall traps for one year at each sampling site. In total, 58 gnaphosid species and 16,592 individuals were collected. Cretan endemic Gnaphosidae were negatively affected by intensive grazing and, contrary to findings on other taxa studied on the island, they were sparse and rare throughout the study area. The species composition of gnaphosid assemblages was primarily determined by elevation. Trachyzelotes lyonneti, Urozelotes rusticus, Zelotes scrutatus, Anagraphis pallens and Berinda amabilis proved to be significant indicators of overgrazing. The vast majority of spiders belonging to synanthropic and nationally red-listed species were found in overgrazed sites. Despite theoretical expectations, while the average activity density decreased, the number of species, evenness, rarity, taxonomic, temporal and functional diversity (FRic) indices increased with increasing grazing intensity. This was mainly due to the nature of disturbance itself, which probably allows equibalanced low abundances of indigenous or synanthropic species, rather than overdominance of few, thus partly refuting the opportunistic species hypothesis (OSH). Ground spider assemblages in overgrazed sites comprised sparse populations of mostly rare, opportunistic species with different combinations of life-history traits that partly replace other species more commonly found in the less degraded sites. Species of these assemblages shorten their phenologies to minimize temporal co-occurrence with each other due to resource limitation. These distinct community patterns highlight ground spiders as good indicators of grazing pressure on Crete, on species and assemblage level. To conserve the indigenous and potentially endangered invertebrate fauna, the spatiotemporal discontinuity of grazing including rested patches is important in order to maintain spatial variability and possibly lead to habitat restoration.","tags":["Gnaphosidae","Crete","Grazing","Disturbance","Diversity patterns"],"title":"Overgrazed shrublands support high taxonomic, functional and temporal diversity of Mediterranean ground spider assemblages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.T.

The values of the residuals from the ISAR log10‐transfomed models of native and endemic taxa were used as a measure of island floristic diversity. Area was confirmed to be the most powerful single explanatory predictor of all diversity metrics. Mean annual precipitation and temperature, as well as shortest distance to the nearest island are also significant predictors of vascular plant diversity. The island of Kalamos constitutes an important plant diversity hotspot in the Ionian archipelago. The recent formation of the islands, the close proximity to the mainland source and the reduced dispersal filtering of the Ionian archipelago resulted in islands with a flora principally comprising common species and a low proportion of endemics. Small islands keep a key role in conservation of plant priority sites.","tags":["Ionian Islands","ISAR","Diversity patterns","GDM"],"title":"Drivers of alpha and beta vascular plant diversity in the Ionian Islands (Greece)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

To bridge this gap, we identify the biogeographical modules (highly linked subgroups of islands and plant taxa) within the Aegean Archipelago. **Location:** The Aegean Archipelago, Greece. **Methods:** We used a network approach to detect island biogeographical roles and modules, based on a large and detailed database including 1498 Aegean endemic and subendemic plant taxa distributed on 59 Aegean Islands and five adjacent mainland areas. **Results:** The Aegean was divided into six biogeographical modules; the network was significantly modular. None of the modules displayed all four possible biogeographical roles (connectors, module hubs, network hubs, peripherals). Six new biogeographical regions in the Aegean were identified. **Main conclusions:** The borders of the six biogeographical regions in the Aegean correspond well to the region’s palaeogeographical evolution from the middle Miocene to the end of the Pleistocene. The Central Aegean acts as an ecogeographical filter for the distribution of several plant lineages across the Aegean Sea, while there seems to be a N-S oriented biogeographical barrier in the Aegean corresponding to the palaeogeographical situation during the middle Ionian. These biogeographical barriers have been fundamental for both plants and animals.","tags":["Aegean biogeography","Networks","Palaeogeography"],"title":"Network biogeography of a complex island system: the Aegean Archipelago revisited","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

An island-specific Area-Distance-Change (ADC) typology was constructed, with higher ADC values representing a higher degree of change. The highest fragmentation rates of the Aegean archipelago occurred in tandem with the largest rates of sea-level-rise occurring between 17 kyr and 7 kyr ago. Sea-level rise resulted in an area loss for the Aegean archipelago of approximately 70%. Spatiotemporal differences in sea-level changes across the Aegean Sea and irregular bathymetry produced a variety of island surface-area loss responses, with area losses ranging from 20% to N90% per island. In addition, sea-level rise led to increased island isolation, increasing distances of islands to continents to N200% for some islands. We discuss how rates of area contractions and distance increases may have affected biotas, their evolutionary history and genetics. Five testable hypotheses are proposed to guide future research. We hypothesize that islands with higher ADC-values will exhibit higher degrees of community hyper-saturation, more local extinctions, larger genetic bottlenecks, higher genetic diversity within species pools, more endemics and shared species on continental fragments and higher z-values of the power-law species-area relationship. The developed typology and the quantified geographic response to sea-level rise of continental islands, as in the Aegean Sea, present an ideal research framework to test biogeographic and evolutionary hypotheses assessing the role of rates of area and distance change affecting biota.","tags":null,"title":"Geographic changes in the Aegean Sea since the Last Glacial Maximum: Postulating biogeographic effects of sea-level rise on islands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

In order to shed light on these processes, we identified biogeographical modules within the phytogeographical area of the Cyclades. **Location:**  The Cyclades, Greece. **Methods:** We used a network approach to detect island biogeographical roles and modules, based on a large and detailed database including the Greek endemic plant taxa of the Cyclades and we tested for nestedness in the island-species matrices. **Results:** The Cyclades were significantly modular and divided into five biogeographical modules. Three of the modules were significantly nested and two displayed all four possible biogeographical roles (connectors, module hubs, network hubs, peripherals). Most of the network’s taxa are classified as peripherals and widespread endemics. **Main conclusions:** The five modules’ borders correspond remarkably well to the palaeogeographical and climatic compartmentalization of the Cyclades. The flora of the Cyclades has not yet reached the relaxation phase and the region may act as an ecogeographical filter for the distribution of several plant lineages. Naxos, Milos and Anafi play an important role for the network’s connectivity, while at least five adjacent phytogeographical regions affect the distribution patterns of the endemic taxa present in the Cyclades.","tags":["Aegean biogeography","Networks","Palaeogeography"],"title":"Network biogeographical analysis of the central Aegean archipelago","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I.

Peloponnese, Greece), after extensive field work (from ca. 700 to 1900 m) and critical literature review. **Results:** The vascular native flora of Mt. Panachaikon comprises 757 taxa, 95 of which are Greek endemics, 79 are Balkan endemics, while 229 taxa are reported here for the first time. The known distribution of the Greek endemics *Alyssum montanum* subsp. *montanum* var. *graecum*, *Carum heldreichii*, *Cirsium heldreichii*, *Genista milii*, *Minuartia eurytanica* and *Seseli parnassicum* is expanded, being reported for the first time for the floristic region of Peloponnese, and the number of the known populations of the Near Threatened *Gymnospermium altaicum* subsp. *peloponnesiacum* is increased. **Conclusions:** The study area appears to have the second highest endemism and the highest one in W. Greece, compared with other mountains of N. Peloponnese and Sterea Ellada, while 22.10% of the endemics are protected and/or evaluated as Near Threatened to Endangered. It also exhibits a rather high proportion of Balkan endemics, in relation to its geographic location, and some genuine arctic-alpine taxa. These indicate that Mt. Panachaikon can be rendered as a plant diversity hotspot in the Peloponnese.

However, these formations are mostly mismanaged and poorly studied in terms of their fauna and the effect of long term land-use. We studied the impact of goat and sheep grazing on the diversity patterns of carabid beetles at sites in relation to possible habitat uniqueness and geographic zonation. In total, 19,322 individuals belonging to 42 Carabidae species were identified. The composition of site assemblages was mainly determined by altitude. The six Cretan endemic species collected were widely distributed on the island and most of them were dominant. Species richness and equitability were significantly lower at overgrazed sites compared to areas with low grazing intensity. The diversity patterns of carabids were influenced by the level of grazing in each study area. As species richness and diversity were maximal under moderate/relatively high levels of grazing (hump-shaped pattern), our results support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Low tolerance of carabid taxa to intensive grazing was also ascertained through the significantly high values of temporal beta diversity at overgrazed sites, independent of local species richness. We conclude that Carabidae are good indicators of grazing pressure in Crete at assemblage level, rather than species-specifically. To maintain diversity and enhance niche space of invertebrate fauna, the spatiotemporal discontinuity of grazing is essential.","tags":["Carabidae","Crete","Grazing","Disturbance","Diversity patterns"],"title":"Ground beetles respond to grazing at assemblage level, rather than species-specifically: The case of Cretan shrublands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.
