## Greece's remarkable plant diversity    
Greece hosts more than 6600 plant taxa, accounting for ca. 30% of the European flora, even though it consists a small fragment of Europe's area. Eight genera are Greek endemics, seven of which are monotypic. Nearly 1500 taxa (22%) are endemic to Greece and new taxa are being described each year^[Approx. 7 taxa/year since 2006].   
  
## The rediscoveries
Several taxa have been described and reported from Greece, but have not been seen or found for a very long time. The most prominent member of this group was *Biebersteinia orphanidis* Boiss. which had not been collected since 1851. In [1994](http://users.uoa.gr/~cthanos/seedecology2004/Rediscovery.pdf), Ass. Prof. Th. Constantinidis found it on a mountain close to Mt. Kyllini. Since then, some other taxa thought to be extinct have been discovered.
