abstract = "The intra-generic relationships within the intriguing genus *Petrorhagia* are currently debated, as the genus is underrepresented in recent taxonomic studies. In this study, we investigate the relationships among the species of *Petrorhagia* sect. *Petrorhagia* subsect. *Saxifragae* occurring in Greece. Based on a combination of ordination methods and discriminant analyses of 36 macromorphological characters, five species are recognized in Greece. The analyses showed that all currently known species from Greece (*P. fasciculata*, *P. graminea*, *P. phthiotica* and *P. saxifraga*) represent distinct taxonomic entities. According to our results, two recently collected populations from SE Peloponnisos represent a fifth, new *Petrorhagia* species, which is first described and illustrated here as *P. laconica*. It is related to the widespread *P. saxifraga* and the Peloponnesian endemic *P. graminea*, but clearly distinct from both species by a combination of morphological characters, including indumentums, inflorescence, calyx, capsule and seed characters."
