abstract = "This contribution to the Greek flora includes distribution extensions and taxonomic notes for some noteworthy plant taxa. New records for certain phytogeographical regions of Greece are presented for: Arum cylindraceum, Convolvulus pentapetaloides. Cruciata taurica, Galanthus reginae-olgae subsp. vernalis, Ilex aquifolium, Linum decumbens, Lythrum thymifolia, Sedum praesidis, Silene congesta and Trifolium diffusum. Allium karistanum, Helichrysum amorginum, Limonium antipaxorum and L. cephalonicum have been recorded for the first time on some islands. New populations of Allium maniaticum and A. ritsii, previously known only from their loci classici, were discovered in the Peloponnese. Valeriana alliariifolia, Silene auriculata subsp. auriculata and Symphytum creticum were rediscovered in central Evvia, confirming long-lost historical records from previous centuries. The presence of V. alliariifolia in Greece and Europe is confirmed for the first time since the 19th century."
