abstract = "*Astragalus maniaticus* and *Aethionema saxatile* subsp. *corinthiacum* have vague taxonomic relationships. *Astragalus maniaticus* was placed in sect. *Hypoglottis*, but shows affinities to *A. suberosus* subsp. *haarbachii* of sect. *Platyglottis*. The *Aethionema saxatile* complex is an intriguing group, due to the wide distribution and morphological variability of its taxa. In order to elucidate the variation patterns of these two endemics and to test their morphological identity, we carried out several multivariate morphometric (stepwise canonical and classificatory) analyses. They revealed that *Astragalus maniaticus* cannot be distinguished from *A. suberosus* subsp. *haarbachii* on morphological grounds. Therefore, it is transferred to sect. *Platyglottis* and regarded a heterotypic synonym of *A. suberosus* subsp. *haarbachii*. The taxonomic interpretation of *Aethionema saxatile* subsp. *corinthiacum* necessitated a broad revision of the *Ae. saxatile* group in Greece and detection of its relations with *Ae. rhodopaeum*, a Bulgarian endemic. The analyses showed that *Ae. saxatile* subsp. *corinthiacum* represents a distinct taxon; likewise, 3 additional subspecies receive support of similar strength: subsp. *creticum*, subsp. *graecum* and subsp. *oreophilum*. Intermediate forms between subsp. *oreophilum* and subsp. *saxatile* were detected in NW Greece. Ae. rhodopaeum is more variable than its original circumscription and is considered as another subspecies of *Ae. saxatile.*"
