## Job opening  
  
In our project entitled **Species on the brink of extinction** funded by the [Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI)](http://www.elidek.gr/en/homepage/) and the [General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT)](http://www.gsrt.gr/central.aspx?sId=119I428I1089I323I488743)  under grant agreement No 2418, we are offering three (3) short-term post-graduate positions.   
  
## Requirements  
  
If you are enthusiastic about working in the field, collecting plant and animal samples and have (some) experience in spatial analysis, species distribution modelling and molecular/genetic techniques, then you should probably consider to apply for one of these positions. You can find a more detailed description (in Greek though) of the required and desired qualifications [here](http://www.elke.uoa.gr/proc_persons_details.aspx?id=2400). Please contact me should you need any more information, I'll be more than happy to answer any of your questions and talk with you about this exciting project.  
  
## Deadline  
  
If interested, you should send your application, CV and all relevant information by $\color{green}{\textbf{22 February 2019}}$ at the latest.
