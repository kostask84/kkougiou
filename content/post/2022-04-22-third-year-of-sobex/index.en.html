<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The third year of <a href="https://www.kkougiou.com/project/internal-project/">SoBEx</a> has also been hard, since due to covid-19 restrictions our team was not able to conduct field research for all the species we wanted to study.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-has-been-done" class="section level2">
<h2>What has been done</h2>
<p>We conducted molecular/genetic analyses for most of the studied animal and plant taxa. We have also run several macroecological analyses so as to estimate the effects of climate change on these Critically Endangered species, as well as to estimate the percent overlap of these speciesâ€™ distribution range with the NATURA 2000 protected areas network (PAs - gap analysis). We ran correlative Species Distribution Models in an ESM ensemble framework, since we were dealing with very rare species.</p>
<p>We have also published part of our work in <em>Diversity</em> and you can find the relevant publication, which made the front cover of this journal <a href="/pdf/Crete-SDM.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/12/7/270">here</a>. This publication won the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/14/4/281/htm">Best Paper Award for 2022</a> and focused on the effects of climate change on the distribution of the Cretan single island endemic plants that are included in SoBEx.</p>
<p>We also published another paper in <em>Diversity</em>, dealing with the conservation genetics of <em>Aethionema retsina</em>, <em>Allium iatrouinum</em> and <em>Convolvulus heldreichii</em> and the how will climate change impact their distribution. You can find it <a href="/pdf/Conservation-Genetics.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/13/4/152">here</a>. This publication has been nominated for the <strong>Best Paper Award for 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>We are now working on a third manuscript that deals with the conservation genetics of <em>Polygala helenae</em>, <em>Centaurea heldreichii</em> and <em>Anthemis glaberrima</em>.</p>
<p>According to the SDM analyses, all of the species under study are projected to become extinct in the coming decades, under any Global Circulation Model (GCM), Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and climate database combination (for instance: Figure <a href="#fig:comb">1</a> or Figure<a href="#fig:comb2">2</a>). Bioclimatic consinstency for our predictions is high, irrespective of the taxon considered (for instance: Figure <a href="#fig:comb3">3</a>). The median percentage loss was 100% across all species. Our models had sufficient predictive power (TSS <span class="math inline">\(\geq 0.75\)</span> - median TSS: 0.78). All models were found to outperform the null expectation at P <span class="math inline">\(&lt; 0.05\)</span>.</p>

<p>According to the gap analysis, the distribution range of the species under study varied from 0.001 km<sup>2</sup> to 9756.2 km<sup>2</sup>. Two gastropods, namely <em>Lindbergia gittenbergeri</em> and <em>Tsoukatosia evauemgei</em>, occur exclusively outside any PA. Thirteen species (nine plants and four gastropods) on the other hand, occur exclusively in PAs. The mean percentage overlap is 48.1%, yet most species (ca. 60%) occur outside the Greek PAs for at least half of their distribution range (Figure <a href="#fig:gap">4</a>). The mean percentage overlap was highest in plants (67.6%), followed by molluscs (47.4%), arthropods (39.7%) and vertebrates (17.1%).</p>

<p>Regarding the genetic diversity analyses, almost for the entirety of the studied taxa, genetic diversity is low, as expected for organisms with small population sizes, that are taxonomically and geographicall isolated.</p>
