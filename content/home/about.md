# About me

  
Kostas is a quantitative ecologist and plant taxonomist. His research interests span from investigating island and mountain biogeographical and biodiversity patterns to assessing the effects of climate and land-use change on plant species distribution, with an emphasis on range-restricted species.   
  
He collaborates closely with [Prof. Panayotis Dimopoulos](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=1WMOcPMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and the [Botany lab](http://botanylab.upatras.gr/) team.    
  
Kostas serves also as a part-time lecturer at the [Department of Biology in the University of Patras](http://www.biology.upatras.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=28&Itemid=101), where he teaches an [undergraduate macroecology course](https://eclass.upatras.gr/courses/BIO357/). He is also a member of the [IUCN Species Survival Commission](https://www.iucn.org/commissions/species-survival-commission).      

He enjoys working with [Ass. Prof. Trigas](http://efp.aua.gr/en/userpages_en/713) from the [Department of Crop Science](http://efp.aua.gr/en) in the Agricultural University of Athens and with [Prof. Halley](https://www.john-halley.com/) and his [EcoLab](https://twitter.com/EcoLab_BET) team.  
  
Kostas is also a member of [Prof. Petanidou](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=Ucv9QyUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)'s [Biogeography and Ecology lab](http://bioecolab-aegean.blogspot.com/2013/11/theodora-petanidou.html) from the [Department of Geography](https://geography.aegean.gr/ppl/index_en.php?content=0&bio=tpet) in the University of the Aegean.  
  
He was a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Ecology and Systematics, Faculty of Biology in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, working with [Ass. Prof. Kostas A. Triantis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=jTzQHXwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Ass. Prof. Aristeidis Parmakelis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=eaNpqN8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) [UAMECO lab](https://sites.google.com/site/uameco/home).  
 
  
He led a research program dealing with the monitoring and conservation planning of the Greek endemic species facing extinction. He got a scholarship from the State Scholarships Foundation (SSF) dealing with the effects of climate change on the distributional patterns of the Greek endemic plant taxa.
